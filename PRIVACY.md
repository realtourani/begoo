# Privacy Policy (Begoo Chrome Extension)

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025

Begoo is a privacy-first Chrome extension designed to provide real-time Persian speech-to-text transcription directly within Google Docs.

**We DO NOT collect any personal user data.**

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

*   **No Personal Information:** Begoo does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, address, age, etc.).
*   **No Audio Storage/Transmission by Begoo:** Microphone audio is sent **directly to Google's Web Speech API** for real-time transcription. The Begoo extension itself does not store, record, or transmit your audio data. The processing of audio by Google's API is subject to [Google's own privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
*   **No Transcribed Text Storage/Transmission by Begoo:** The transcribed text is immediately inserted into your Google Docs document and is not stored, logged, or transmitted by Begoo.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** Begoo requests only the absolutely necessary browser permissions (`activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, and host permission for `https://docs.google.com/`) solely for its stated purpose of facilitating transcription within Google Docs. These permissions are not used for data collection.
*   **No Analytics, Tracking, or Advertising:** Begoo does not integrate any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

Your privacy is our priority. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please feel free to open an issue on this GitHub repository.
